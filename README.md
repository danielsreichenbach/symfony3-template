# An opinionated Symfony 3.0 baseline template

You could say, I was really excited when [Symfony 3.0][symfony] was released,
as it does bring welcome change such as saying farewell to Assetic (no hard
feelings!), or a more pleasant structure for building applications.

Then again, I am a huge fan of [laracasts][laracasts], and enjoy watching how
Jeffrey Way builds makes use of Laravel and [Gulp][gulpjs], and also the new
[Laravel Elixir][elixir] helper. Yeah, that. Asset management in Symfony was
painful. Wo did not curse when hooking up Assetic to `node`, `sass`, etc.

So this project template is different as it tries to bring some of the fun
people are having with Laravel and a "modern" toolchain to Symfony (which is
awesome but is always so damn serious).

This baseline template is the result. While you previously needed PHP, Ruby,
NodeJS and NPM and then set them up in a very specific way, all you need now
is a default PHP and NodeJS setup, and then you can build, test, and deploy.

## Requirements

To enjoy this template, I recommend a PHP installation of version 5.5, and
NodeJS version 4.2. Newer versions of course are fine but make sure to check
the limits of your production environment first.
